## Why? ðŸ¤·

There are several example apps on GitHub using Phoenix LiveView
but none include are step-by-step instructions
a _complete_ beginner can follow.
This repository is the **_complete beginner's_ tutorial**
we _wish_ we had when **learning LiveView**
and the one _you_ have been looking for!

> Chris McCord the creator of Phoenix and LiveView has an example:
[https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_live_view_example](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_live_view_example/tree/e3966aca18f7d8f4da84d197e3ee22af4050fd5e)
At the time of writing, we feel that it is not very beginner-friendly.
Only the default "_start your Phoenix server_" instructions are included,
and the dependencies have
[diverged](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_live_view_example/issues/56)
so the exampled does not _run_.
We totally understand that Chris is focussing _building_
Phoenix and LiveView so we decided to fill in the gaps
and write this tutorial.



## What? ðŸ’­

A _complete beginners_ tutorial for building
the most basic possible Phoenix LiveView App
with no prior experience necessary.



## Who? ðŸ‘¤

This tutorial is aimed at people who have
never built _anything_ in Phoenix or LiveView.





## How? ðŸ’»





To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install --prefix assets`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## Credits ðŸ™Œ

All credit for this tutorial goes to Dennis Beatty
[@dnsbty](https://github.com/dnsbty)
for his superb post:

and corresponding video: https://youtu.be/2bipVjOcvdI

We recommend _everyone_ learning `Elixir`
subscribe to his YouTube channel and watch _all_ his videos
as they are a _superb_ resource.

The 3 key differences
between this tutorial and Dennis' original post are:

1. **_Complete_ code** commit (snapshot) at the end of each section.
(_not just snippets of code_)
2. **_Latest_ Phoenix, Elixir and LiveView** versions.
3. ***Test Driven Development*** is followed so _complete_ beginners
can see how easy it is to write reliable code in a basic example.
